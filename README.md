# Walking Dead GIFs

This is a basic web page that diplays gifs from GIPHY based on user selection. There are pre-populated buttons that will run a GIPHY search, or the user can create thier own. Whatever the user selects will have "Walking+Dead" appended to the query, so it will always be a Walking Dead search. 

Gifs will play upon clicking and stop on second click. 

The program was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX and the GIPHY API.
